#' @param skip A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
#'  recipe is baked by [recipes::bake.recipe()]? While all operations are baked
#'  when [recipes::prep.recipe()] is run, some operations may not be able to be
#'  conducted on new data (e.g. processing the outcome variable(s)).
#'  Care should be taken when using `skip = FALSE`.
